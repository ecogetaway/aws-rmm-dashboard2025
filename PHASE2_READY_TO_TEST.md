## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Test with Mock Mode (No AWS Required)

```bash
# Test the Bedrock integration
cd backend
export MOCK_MODE=true
python test_bedrock_integration.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Testing Bedrock Model Integration
✅ All tests passed!
```

### Option 2: Test with Real Bedrock (AWS Credentials Required)

```bash
# Set AWS credentials
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
export MOCK_MODE=false

# Run tests
cd backend
python test_bedrock_integration.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Testing Bedrock Model Integration
Response: Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service...
Usage: {'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 42}
✅ All tests passed!
```

### Option 3: Full End-to-End Test

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
./start-backend.sh
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Browser:**
```
Visit: http://localhost:3002/agents/chat
Try: "High CPU alert on server prod-web-01, please diagnose"
```

## 📊 What You Can Demo

### Incident Analysis (Recommended for Judges!)

**Query:**
```
"High CPU alert on server prod-web-01, please diagnose and fix"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Frontend shows "Routed to incident_agent"
2. Tool traces appear: `query_client_inventory`, `analyze_cloudwatch_metrics`
3. AI streams response word-by-word
4. Final response includes:
   - Incident ID: `INC-12345678`
   - Root cause analysis with 85% confidence
   - Remediation plan with actions
   - Risk assessment and estimated resolution time

### General IT Query

**Query:**
```
"What are the benefits of cloud monitoring?"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Orchestrator handles directly
2. Real Bedrock response streams
3. No tool traces (pure conversation)

### Complex Multi-Tool Query

**Query:**
```
"Analyze memory usage spike on all our production databases"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Routes to Incident Agent
2. Multiple tools execute (inventory, CloudWatch for each DB)
3. AI synthesizes findings across all systems
4. Comprehensive remediation plan

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `python test_bedrock_integration.py` in mock mode
- [ ] (Optional) Run tests with real Bedrock
- [ ] Start backend with `./start-backend.sh`
- [ ] Start frontend with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Visit `http://localhost:3002/agents/chat`
- [ ] Test incident query: "High CPU alert..."
- [ ] Test general query: "What are..."
- [ ] Verify streaming works (tokens appear word-by-word)
- [ ] Verify tool traces appear
- [ ] Verify demo mode works (backend offline)

## 🎯 Demo Script for Judges

### 1. Show Homepage (Dashboard)
```
URL: https://aws-rmm.netlify.app/
"This is our multi-tenant RMM dashboard with real-time monitoring"
```

**Highlight:**
- Real-time metrics updating
- Server health status
- Alert acknowledgment with auto-remediation
- Incident timeline

### 2. Show Agent Console
```
URL: http://localhost:3002/agents/chat
"Now let's see our AI agent in action"
```

**Demo Query:**
```
"High CPU alert on server prod-web-01, please diagnose and recommend a fix"
```

**Narration:**
```
1. "The orchestrator is routing this to our Incident Agent"
2. "Watch as it gathers real system data via CloudWatch and inventory tools"
3. "The AI is analyzing the root cause using Bedrock"
4. "And here's our remediation plan with risk assessment"
5. "Notice the 85% confidence score and estimated resolution time"
```

### 3. Highlight Key Features
```
"Our system provides:
- Multi-agent orchestration with intelligent routing
- Real-time tool execution with tracing
- AI-powered root cause analysis using Amazon Bedrock
- Autonomous remediation with human-in-the-loop approval
- Both demo mode and live AWS integration"
```

## 💡 Tips for Hackathon

### If Backend is Down
- ✅ Frontend still works in demo mode!
- ✅ Intelligent fallback responses
- ✅ No "red error box" in production build
- ✅ Perfect for judges to test quickly

### If AWS Credentials Not Available
- ✅ Use `MOCK_MODE=true`
- ✅ All features work
- ✅ Realistic responses
- ✅ Tool execution simulated

### Impressive Features to Highlight
1. **Real Bedrock Streaming** - Word-by-word output
2. **Multi-Agent System** - Intelligent routing
3. **Tool Orchestration** - Automated data gathering
4. **Root Cause Analysis** - AI-powered diagnostics
5. **Confidence Scoring** - Trust indicators
6. **Risk Assessment** - Safety-first remediation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Must be 3.11+

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Try mock mode
export MOCK_MODE=true
python backend/app.py
```

### Frontend shows errors
```bash
# Build for production (no dev errors)
npm run build
npx serve out -p 3003
```

### Tests fail
```bash
# Ensure mock mode for offline testing
export MOCK_MODE=true
python backend/test_bedrock_integration.py
```
