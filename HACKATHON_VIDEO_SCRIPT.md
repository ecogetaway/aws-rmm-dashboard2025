### **[0:50-1:40] Demo Scenario 1: Health Monitoring with AI Analysis** (50 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to AI Agent Console]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "Let's see it in action. From the Agents page, I'll open the AI Agent Console—a natural language interface to your entire infrastructure."

**[ACTION: Navigate to /agents/chat and click on 'Check health status' suggested prompt]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "I'll ask the agent to check our system health."

**[SCREEN: Show streaming response + tool traces appearing in real-time]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "Watch what happens. This is real Amazon Bedrock streaming—not simulated responses. The Orchestrator agent routes this to our Monitoring specialist, which then:"

**[POINT TO SCREEN as each appears]**

1. **"Queries our EC2 inventory..."** ✓ Tool: query_client_inventory
2. **"Analyzes CloudWatch metrics in real-time..."** ✓ Tool: analyze_cloudwatch_metrics  
3. **"And uses Amazon Bedrock's Claude Sonnet 4 to provide intelligent analysis..."**

**[SCREEN: Show full agent response with insights streaming token-by-token]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "Within seconds, we get a comprehensive health report with actionable insights—not just raw data, but intelligent analysis powered by Claude Sonnet 4."

**[HIGHLIGHT on screen]:**
```
⚠️ Anomaly Detected: High CPU on server-web-01
📊 Confidence: 87%
💡 Recommendation: Proactive remediation required
```

**NOTE:** The agent is streaming real responses using Amazon Bedrock—this is production-grade AI integration.

### **[1:40-2:20] Demo Scenario 2: Autonomous Actions & Human-in-the-Loop** (40 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Show Actions Panel appearing with proposed remediation]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "But here's where it gets powerful. The agent doesn't just report problems—it proposes solutions."

**[ACTION: Click 'Analyze CPU usage' prompt]**

**[SCREEN: Show agent analyzing + action proposal appearing]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "See this? The Incident Agent has detected high CPU utilization and automatically proposed a remediation action."

**[POINT TO Actions Panel]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "But—and this is critical for production environments—it waits for human approval."

**[ACTION: Hover over the action, show details]**

**[HIGHLIGHT on screen]:**
```
Action: Restart Apache service on i-0a1b2c3d4e5f
Risk Level: Low
Rationale: Memory leak detected, restart will clear process
Estimated Impact: 30-second downtime
```

**[ACTION: Click 'Approve' button]**

**NARRATOR:**

> "One click, and the agent executes the fix using AWS Systems Manager."

**[SCREEN: Show action status changing: Pending → Executing → Completed]**

## 🎥 **Production Notes**

### **Visual Guidelines**

1. **Screen Recording:**
   - Record at 1920x1080 resolution
   - Use clean browser window (hide bookmarks bar)
   - Enable cursor highlighting for better visibility
   - Slow down cursor movements for clarity

2. **Highlight Key Moments:**
   - Use zoom-ins or callout boxes for:
     - Tool traces appearing in real-time
     - Agent streaming tokens
     - Action proposal details
     - Status changes (Pending → Completed)

3. **Transitions:**
   - Keep transitions quick and professional
   - Use fade or simple cuts (avoid flashy effects)
   - Match transition timing with narration

4. **Text Overlays:**
   - Use clean, modern fonts (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
   - Blue/purple accent colors matching the dashboard theme
   - Ensure text is readable at all screen sizes

### **Audio Guidelines**

1. **Narration:**
   - Professional but conversational tone
   - Clear enunciation, moderate pace
   - Emphasize key terms: "Bedrock," "autonomous," "real-time"
   - Record in a quiet environment with good acoustics

2. **Background Music (Optional):**
   - Subtle, modern tech music
   - Keep volume low (narration should dominate)
   - Use royalty-free music (Epidemic Sound, Artlist)

3. **Sound Effects (Minimal):**
   - Subtle "whoosh" for transitions
   - Soft click sounds for button interactions
   - Keep effects subtle and professional

### **B-Roll Footage Ideas**

- AWS console screenshots (CloudWatch metrics)
- Code editor showing agent implementation
- Architecture diagrams (can be animated)
- Mock incident scenarios
- Dashboard graphs updating in real-time
